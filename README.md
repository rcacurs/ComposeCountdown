## :scroll: Description
This app was built for Week 2 #AndroidDevChallenge. The task was to built the countdown timer, 
entirely using Jetpack Compose. Applications contains single screen with timer display and the controls.
The countdown time can be set by clicking on the timer screen, and the tex fields will appear to enter
minutes and seconds. When timer runs out confetti salute is started!


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I am now starting to get back into Android development, and want to learn the upcomming Jetpack Compose
library. From my first experience I really loved building the UI using compose, because it really
allows to build highly dynamic UI, which makes the experience so much more fun! It was really fun to
learn about state in composable functions,stateless and stateful composables and hoisting.
